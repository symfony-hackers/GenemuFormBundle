UPGRADE to 3.0
==============

*This document is not really actual for now*

~~`3.*` is a transition step before `4.*`, where the supported form types will be reduced.
Deprecation triggers will be added in unsupported types until they're eventually removed in `4.*`.~~

~~Even though it requires the composer `@dev`flag, the `3.*` version focuses on stability.
We didn't introduce a separate branch to make maintenance easier.~~

### ~~Form types~~

~~The bundle now mainly focuses on form types being related to a backend application :~~

- ~~Captcha (requires session, generation of a code with GD extension)~~
- ~~ReCaptcha (requires an HTTP API call)~~
- ~~Autocomplete, Select2 (requires custom transformers, AJAX endpoint)~~
- ~~Plain~~

~~All other types should be considered as removed.~~

### ~~Symfony version~~

~~The bundle supports Symfony 3 and Symfony 4.~~
